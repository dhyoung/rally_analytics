        <p>Rally Analytics</p>

<p>This project makes it easier to get data from Rally's Analytics web services endpoints. Due to the magic of server/desktop-side 
JavaScript provided by Node.js, it serves as both a REST Toolkit for script-based access, as well as a data access library for 
running inside of a browser.</p>

<h2>Concepts</h2>

<p>In order for you to be productive using the Rally Analytics API, there are two things you'll need to wrap your head around:</p>

<ol>
<li>The MVCC-like snapshot data model</li>
<li>The MongoDB-like query language</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Snapshot Data Model</strong></p>

<p>The data model for the repository that sits under this API has been carefully crafted for efficient analytics. It is particularly 
well suited to seeing how your data changes over time which is the focus of most reports (burn charts, defect trend, cumulative flow, etc.). 
The data is stored in a snapshot schema which means that every time there is a change, an entirely new snapshot of the effected entity is 
saved with the new values (as well as the previous ones). The older snapshot is not removed. It is only updated to adjust its _ValidTo timestamp. </p>

<p>Let's say you have this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  _id: 'B2E...',  # GUID just for analytics engine
  ObjectID: 777,  # objectID (OID) from Rally
  Name: "Footer disappears when using new menu",
  State: "Submitted",
  _ValidFrom: "2011-01-01T12:34:56Z",
  _ValidTo: "9999-01-01T00:00:00Z",  # "current" snapshot
  OtherField: 'Other Value'  # ... Other fields not shown
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then on January 2, 2011, at noon GMT, the analytics engine receives a notice that Rally object 777 had its "State" field changed from "Submitted" 
to "Open". The latest record for rally object 777 is read. Its _validTo is updated but nothing else is changed in that record. Rather, a new record 
is created showing the new value as well as the previous values for the field(s) that changed. So, the repository would now contain the updated 
original plus the new snapshot like so:</p>

<pre><code>{
  _id: 'B2E...',  # GUID just for analytics engine
  ObjectID: 777,  # objectID (OID) from Rally
  Name: "Footer disappears when using new menu",
  State: "Submitted",
  _ValidFrom: "2011-01-01T12:34:56Z",  
  _ValidTo: "2011-01-02T12:00:00Z",  # updated
  OtherField: 'Other Value'  # ... Other fields not shown
}

{
  _id: 'A37...',  # a new analytics "document" so it gets a new _id
  ObjectID: 777,  # same Rally OID
  Name: "Footer disappears when using new menu",
  State: "Open",
  _ValidFrom: "2011-01-02:12:00:00Z",  # equals B2Eâ€™s _ValidTo
  _ValidTo: "9999-01-01T00:00:00Z",    
  _PreviousValues: {
    State: "Submitted"
  },
  OtherField: 'Other Value'  # ... Other fields not shown
}
</code></pre>

<p>Things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>Every time there is a change, an entirely new snapshot of the effected entity is saved with the new values (as well as the unchanged ones).  </li>
<li>The _PreviousValues field stores the values that were replaced when this particular snapshot was added.</li>
<li>The way _ValidFrom and _ValidTo are manipulated, you can rely upon the property that for a given Rally ObjectID, only one version of the object 
will be active for any moment in time.</li>
<li>Null ("No Entry") values are not stored except...</li>
<li>There is a special case where a value is changed from null to a non-null value. In this case, the _PreviousValues field will explicitly say 
that it was null before the change.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Query Language</strong></p>

<p>The query language understood by Rally's Analytics API, is based upon the <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Advanced+Queries">MongoDB query language</a>.
You string together a number of clauses to pull back the "documents" of interest. This API supports the following operators.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>{a: 10}</code> - docs where a is 10 or an array containing the value 10</li>
<li><code>{a: 10, b: "hello"}</code> - docs where a is 10 and b is "hello"</li>
<li><code>{a: {$gt: 10}}</code> - docs where a > 10, also $lt, $gte, and $lte   </li>
<li><code>{a: {$ne: 10}}</code> - docs where a != 10 </li>
<li><code>{a: {$in: [10, "hello"]}}</code> - docs where a is either 10 or "hello"</li>
<li><code>{a: {$exists: true}}</code> - docs containing an "a" field</li>
<li><code>{a: {$exists: false}}</code> - docs not containing an "a" field</li>
<li><code>{a: {$type: 2}}</code> - docs where a is a string (see bsonspec.org for more types)</li>
<li><code>{a: /foo.*bar/}</code> - docs where a matches the regular expression "foo.*bar"</li>
<li><code>{"a.b": 10}</code> - docs where a is an embedded document where b is 10</li>
<li><code>{$or: [{a: 1}, {b: 2}]}</code> - docs where a is 1 or b is 2</li>
<li><code>{$and: [{a: 1}, {b: 2}]}</code> - docs where a is 1 and b is 2</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>More usage examples are provided in the API Documentation for each Class/Method but here is a quick walkthrough of a common usage.</p>

<p>First, you need to "require" the desired analytics query class(es). We're also going to require a mock
for the XMLHttpResponse Object but you will simply pass in the browser's XMHttpRequest Object (or 
the equivalent from node-XMLHttpRequest if running on node.js)</p>

<pre><code>rally_analytics = require('../')
{GuidedAnalyticsQuery, XHRMock} = rally_analytics
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you need to set the config Object.</p>

<pre><code>config =
  'X-RallyIntegrationName': 'My Chart'
  'X-RallyIntegrationVendor': 'My Company'
  'X-RallyIntegrationVersion': '0.1.0'
  username: null  # if running in browser, will prompt
  password: null  # if running in Node.js will look for RALLY_USERNAME/RALLY_PASSWORD environment variables
  workspaceOID: 12345
  additionalHeaders: [ 
    someHeader: 'Some Value'
  ]
</code></pre>

<p>Now you are ready to instantiate your analytics query.</p>

<pre><code>query = new GuidedAnalyticsQuery(config, XHRMock)  # You would use XMLHttpRequest
</code></pre>

<p>And, specify query clauses.</p>

<pre><code>query.type('HierarchicalRequirement')
     .scope('_ProjectHierarchy', 1234)
     .leafOnly()
     .additionalCriteria({Blocked: true})
</code></pre>

<p>Next, specify a callback.</p>

<pre><code>callback = () -&gt;
  console.log(this.allResults.length)  # will spit back 5 from our XHRMock
# 5
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, call getAll()</p>

<pre><code>query.getAll(callback)
</code></pre>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>To upgrade the capabilities of the data access tools, you should do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fork this repository.</li>
<li>Make your code changes.</li>
<li>Write tests and confirm their successful operation with <code>cake test</code>.</li>
<li>Upgrade the documentation and make sure the examples in it are accurate by running <code>cake docs</code>,
which depends upon <a href="https://github.com/lmaccherone/coffeedoctest">CoffeeDocTest</a>. Note, this will
generate documentation from the here-comments in the source code.
If you want to publish the documentation to your own account, you can also run <code>cake pub-docs</code>.</li>
<li>Submit a pull request which will tell us about your changes.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to build upon one of the examples to make your own App, then we recommend that you
follow the process above, except that you should rename the repository after you fork it. Alternatively,
you could add the data access code from this repository to a larger project repository and go from there.</p>
